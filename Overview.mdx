## What You Get

For commercial queries, the API returns structured offers including:

- Product title & description

- Image links

- Contextual attributes & tags

- Price & currency

- Advertiser & monetization details

- Available promotions & exclusive deals



## How It Works

- Send a request to the Adgentic API endpoint with the user’s query.

- The API analyzes the query for shopping intent.

- If intent is commercial or potential commercial, it returns a structured JSON object containing product offers.

- If intent is non-commercial, it returns an empty response with "response": false.
